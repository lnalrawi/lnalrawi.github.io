                                        In Addition, I’m a fourth year Ph.D. Candidate in the Interactive Systems Research Group at the University of Klagenfurt. Curr­ently, my work is fo­cused on in­ter­ac­tion de­sign, user-centered design and eva­lua­tion methods, and vis­ual com­muni­cation under the supervision of Associate Prof. Dr. David Ahlström.

                                    <p>Layth Nabeel AlRawi was born on March 5th, 1986, in Mosul, Iraq. After graduating from Mosul University with a degree in Computer Science in 2008, he began his professional journey in the oil and gas industry in Basra, southern Iraq. From 2008 to 2014, Layth worked at Weatherford as a Torque Turn System Engineer, quickly advancing to the role of Torque Turn System Lab Supervisor. In 2014, he joined Nabors Drilling. After three years as a Well Construction Operations Supervisor with Tesco, he transitioned to Parker Wellbore in Iraq as Operations Manager in 2017.<br><br>
                                        With eight years of field experience (2008-2016) and a desire to further his knowledge in engineering and technology, Layth decided to pursue a master's degree. In 2016, he began his studies in Computer Science at Çankaya University in Ankara, Turkey,under the supervision of Dr. Tolga Pusatli, focusing on human factors in energy informatics. While completing his master's, he continued his career with Parker Wellbore as Operations Manager in Erbil, overseeing multiple product lines, including Tubular Running Services, Drilling Rental Tools, and Machine Shop operations. He balanced his demanding work schedule with his academic pursuits, and in 2019, he earned his master's degree. <br><br>
                                        In line with his research interests and 12 years of experience in the oil and gas industry, Layth sought a role in technology. Since November 2020, he has been working as a Global Data Science and Software Engineer at Parker Wellbore in Houston, Texas, where he drives digital innovation and technology transformation.<br><br>
                                        Driven by his passion for the intersection of technology and human interaction, Layth enrolled in a PhD program in 2021 in Human-Computer Interaction at the Interactive Design Research Group within the Technical Sciences Department at Klagenfurt University, Austria, under the supervision of Dr. David Ahlstrom. He is currently exploring interactive design, augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR), contributing to innovations in these fields.<br><br>
                                        Feel free to connect with Layth to learn more about his current projects or to discuss potential collaborations.
