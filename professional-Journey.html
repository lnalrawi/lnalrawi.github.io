                            my research focuses on applying Fitts' Law to enhance user interface design and interaction techniques, particularly in AR/VR environments.
                             I aim to explore how hand-pointing and hand-held devices can be optimized for better interaction efficiency and usability. 
                             My work will integrate eye-tracking, mid-air technologies, and haptic feedback to study how visual attention and tactile sensations 
                             influence user performance in 3D object selection. Ultimately, I strive to develop gesture-based interfaces that improve user experience 
                             and are inclusive of diverse abilities, using empirical data to refine interaction models for enhanced usability.

                            In my master’s thesis, I focused on human factors within Energy Informatics, using the Torque Turn system as an example.
                            This program provided me with comprehensive insights into the intricacies of critical systems in the energy sector and equipped
                            me with advanced knowledge and skills to address and mitigate human errors within such systems.
                            Throughout the program, I engaged in rigorous research, analysis, and practical application of informatics principles to understand
                            the underlying causes of errors in torque turn operations. I successfully completed coursework covering topics such as human factors
                            in oil and gas informatics, enhancing my proficiency in data analysis, system optimization, and error prevention strategies.
