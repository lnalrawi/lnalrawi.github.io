                                        industry is limited. In this study, the Oil and Gas sector is targeted since we have found the use of distance training and learning

                                        with Coronavirus 2019 Disease (COVID-19). Human factors that influence e-learning systems for Oil and Gas companies are targeted and 
                                        investigated. An investigation had conducted in order to gain insights into human factors. Questionnaires were collected from 76 
                                        employees from the field. The findings show that learner’s education, system interface, computer literacy, organization support, and 
                                        teaching methods were identified as factors affecting e-learning systems. This research will play an essential role in helping oil

                                    the writer’s attitude towards a practical topic, products or services is positive, negative or neutral. In this study, Machine 
                                    Learning techniques are used to perform sentiment analysis on Oil and Gas customer feedback data. We present a comparison of 
                                    different classification algorithms used for opinion mining,<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more" style="display:none;"> including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), 
                                    Instance Based Learning (IB3), Random Forest (RF), Partial Decision trees (PART), and Logit Boost (LB). Many studies have been 
                                    performed on sentiment analysis in different sectors, but research into Oil and Gas customer feedback has been limited. Therefore, 
                                    we have targeted a pathless sector, namely the Petroleum sector, where companies express their opinions towards specific products or 
                                    services. Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) is used for experimental results. The WEKA environment is open source 
                                    software entailing a collection of machine learning algorithms to solve data mining problems. The main aim of this study is to evaluate 
                                    the efficiency of the above mentioned classifiers in terms of Precision, Recall, F-Measure and Accuracy. The findings of the comparison 
                                    analysis indicate that the Naïve-Bayes classifier gives the best Accuracy of all classifiers. A small dataset could be considered as 
                                    a limitation to our study due to the difficulty of gaining more datasets at the time of the research. However, this research will play 
                                    a vital role for researchers in making decisions about the algorithm that they are going to use to solve their data mining problems.</span>

                                        between system availability and human behavior. An investigation has been performed following the descriptive methodology in order 
                                        to gain insights into human error factors. Questionnaires related to software/hardware errors and errors due to the end user were 
                                        collected from 81 site workers. The findings indicate a potential relation between end user behavior and system availability. 
                                        Training, experience, education, work shifts, system interface, usage of memory sticks and I/O devices were identified as factors 
                                        affecting end user behavior, hence system availability and efficiency.</span>
